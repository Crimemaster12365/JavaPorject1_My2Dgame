# 2D Adventure Game

A hardcore Java-based 2D adventure game developed in NetBeans, inspired by classic pixel art RPGs.

## Features

- Rich, pixelated 2D world with diverse environments:
  - Dense forests with detailed tree sprites
  - Navigable ponds and water bodies
  - Stone walls and structures

- Player character:
  - Pixel art sprite with animations
  - Collision detection for environment interaction

- Game mechanics:
  - Chest and key system for item collection and puzzle-solving
  - Robust collision function for realistic world interaction

- Audio:
  - Background music (BGM) to enhance atmosphere
  - Sound effects for actions and environment

## Technical Details

### Core Technologies
- Language: Java
- IDE: NetBeans

### Graphics
- Custom sprite sheets for characters and environment
- Tile-based map system for efficient rendering

### Audio System
- JavaSound API for BGM and SFX implementation
- Dynamic audio loading and playback

### Game Loop
- Fixed time step game loop for consistent updates
- Separate render and update methods for optimal performance

### Collision Detection
- Pixel-perfect collision for precise interactions
- Spatial partitioning for efficient large-scale collision checks

### Asset Management
- Resource manager for centralized loading and caching of sprites and audio

## Current Status
This project is currently incomplete but functional, demonstrating core gameplay elements and serving as a solid foundation for further development.

## Future Plans
- Implement inventory system
- Add NPCs and dialogue system
- Expand world map and add new environments
- Create quest system
- Implement save/load functionality
